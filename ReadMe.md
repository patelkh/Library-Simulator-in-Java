Library Simulator Author: Kay Patel

The Library Simulator is written in Java. 

It allows you to create and manage libraries. A library tracks inventory items, tracks library members and member's account. 

A member can perform the following activities: 

1. check out items
2. check the location of an item
3. request items 
4. return items back to the library
